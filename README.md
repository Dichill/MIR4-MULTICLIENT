# MIR4-MULTICLIENT
Currently Work in Progress, If you want to help please DM me in Discord: Shiiva#4227
This is a proof of concept. There is proof that we can possibly launch multiple instances of mir4 but there is no working method yet.

## Obfuscation
- Crypto Obfuscator (Minimum Level) - Probably to avoid Virus Detection (If its Maximum it often false positive.)
- SAE can easily deobfuscate the file but there are some methods that are somewhat scrambled which forced me to backtrack them and convert them to somewhat readable code.

## Important
- If this works, there is a limit of how many tabs of MIR4 can be opened. This cannot be bypassed unless you meddle with the Game itself. What this Application does is replicating what the Launcher does but removes the restriction of not having 3 or more instances.

## What I Found
- Embed Bytes (Somewhat an Embedded SDK of MIR4 that has certain parameters needed to Launch a game)
- Found a way to get the LauncherToken but doesn't seem to work for now.
- You can run the Game but you cannot get pass to the "Run from the Launcher"
- Embedded File converted to Stream. (This is the process from the MIR4 Launcher, currently analyzing the Launcher.)

## Notes
- Don't mind the UI, we are currently focusing on the core itself.
